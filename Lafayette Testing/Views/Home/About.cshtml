						<p>Since our beginning in 1992, LTS has experienced substantial growth. The success of our company is a result of our operating philosophy. We put the customer first by considering <strong>Time, Cost, Quality and Customer Service.</strong></p>

We are constantly looking for ways to improve inspections and refine current procedures without compromising quality. Unexpected failures can result in <strong>Costly</strong> repairs, downtime, and injury due to consequential damages. Our technical services can reduce the risk of such occurrences.

						<h2>LTS Laboratory Diversification Program</h2>
						<p>In 1997, LTS established our Laboratory Diversification Program. To compliment our Nondestructive Testing services we&#39;ve added other quality services such as Sandblasting, Welding, Mechanical Polishing, and CNC Precision Machining to achieve our goal of total customer satisfaction and to deliver outstanding quality services in a timely manner at a competitive rate.</p>
